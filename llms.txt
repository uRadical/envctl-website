# envctl

> Git for your secrets.

envctl is a peer-to-peer secrets management CLI for development teams. It enables secure sharing of environment variables and secrets without requiring cloud accounts or complex infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **P2P Sync**: Secrets sync directly between teammates over the internet. No central server required.
- **Post-Quantum Encryption**: Uses ML-KEM-768 encryption to protect secrets against future quantum attacks.
- **Signed Audit Trail**: Every change is cryptographically signed. Know who changed what, and when.
- **Git-like Workflow**: Familiar commands (push, pull, status, log) with branch-like environments for dev, staging, prod.
- **Zero Trust**: Secrets never leave your hardware unencrypted. No cloud storage, no SaaS dependencies.
- **Optional Relay**: For async sync when teammates are offline. The relay only sees encrypted blobs.

## Installation

```bash
go install envctl.dev/go/envctl@latest
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Generate your identity
envctl init

# Create a project
envctl project create

# Add secrets
envctl env var set API_KEY=sk_live_...

# Invite teammates
envctl project invite alice@example.com

# Use secrets (writes .env file)
envctl env use prod
```

## Common Commands

- `envctl init` - Generate identity
- `envctl project create` - Create project
- `envctl join` - Join existing project
- `envctl env var set KEY=val` - Add or update secret
- `envctl env var delete KEY` - Remove secret
- `envctl env var list` - Show secrets
- `envctl env use <env>` - Write .env file
- `envctl env create <name>` - Create environment
- `envctl env delete <name>` - Delete environment
- `envctl status` - Show sync status
- `envctl log` - View history
- `envctl project invite` - Invite teammate
- `envctl project relay set <url>` - Enable relay sync
- `envctl daemon start` - Start background daemon

## Environments

Projects support multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) with separate secrets. Team members can have access to specific environments.

## Relay Server

The optional relay enables async sync when teammates are offline. Messages are stored encrypted and delivered when peers come online. The relay never sees unencrypted secrets.

Public relay: `wss://relay.envctl.dev/ws`

## Pricing

- **Free**: Public relay, 7-day retention, rate limited
- **Pro** ($12/month): 30-day retention, no rate limits, priority sync
- **Enterprise**: Dedicated relay, unlimited retention, self-hosting option

## Comparison

Unlike Doppler, Infisical, HashiCorp Vault, or 1Password:
- No cloud account required (without self-hosting overhead)
- True P2P sync - no server needed for basic use
- Post-quantum encryption (ML-KEM-768)
- No per-seat pricing for the CLI
- Git-like CLI workflow
